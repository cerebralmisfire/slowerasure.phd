## 2.5 Conclusion

This chapter has laid the groundwork for understanding the epistemological and methodological underpinnings of this research. By employing ethnography as a methodology, I uncover the layered complexities of Palestinian experiences under Israeli settler-colonialism and its implementation of slow erasure. Ethnography, with its emphasis on participant observation, interviews, and critical engagement, provides a lens through which to view the interconnected dynamics of agency, identity, episteme, and resistance. The addition of secondary data sources complements the ethnographic data. Through this approach, I am able to navigate the ethical, political, and personal dimensions of researching within a context marked by power asymmetries and systemic violence.

The chapter has also underscored the emancipatory potential of critical social science, feminist methodologies, and context-informed research. These frameworks challenge dominant epistemologies, amplify marginalised voices, and foreground the lived realities of those subjected to structural oppression. By prioritising critical reflexivity and ethical integrity, this research seeks to contribute to decolonial knowledge production while recognising the limitations and responsibilities inherent in my positionality.

This chapter has set the stage for a nuanced exploration of how settler-colonial practices seek to erase Indigenous agency and epistemologies. It also highlights the resilience and strategies of resistance employed by Palestinians, thus contributing to the broader discourse on power, knowledge, and liberation.
