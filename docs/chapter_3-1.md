## 3.1 Settler-colonialism

The distinction between colonialism and settler-colonialism lies primarily in the relationship between the colonisers and Indigenous populations, and the intended permanence of the colonial presence [@wolfe2006; @veracini2011]. Colonialism is a power relationship in which a foreign minority dominates an Indigenous majority (or one brought in through force). Crucial decisions affecting the lives of the colonised are taken by the colonial rulers, typically to serve interests determined in a distant imperial centre. Rather than engaging in cultural exchange or compromise, the colonisers maintain a belief in their own superiority and in their supposed duty to rule [@osterhammel1997]. On the other hand, settler-colonialism aims to establish a new sovereign society by eliminating and replacing Indigenous peoples [@veracini2017]. As Patrick Wolfe states: “Settler-colonialism destroys to replace” [@wolfe2006, 388]. This process is not primarily driven by race or religion, but by the logic of possession and control over territory. In this system, invasion is not a one-time act but a structure, ongoing, pervasive, and fundamentally tied to land [@wolfe2006; @veracini2017].

Shino Konishi [@konishi2019] notes that while both Crystal McKinnon [@mckinnon2010] and Barry Judd [@judd2017] draw on settler-colonial theory, they ultimately view the logic of elimination as an enduring or intermittent desire for settler-colonialism rather than an overarching structure. They emphasise Indigenous agency and, like Aileen Moreton-Robinson [@moreton-robinson2015], articulate more optimistic narratives of Indigenous cultural and social resistance to 'discursive elimination' and a resurgence of Indigenous identity. McKinnon [@mckinnon2010] and Judd [@judd2017] highlight the persistence of Indigenous identity, showcasing various ways Indigenous people have resisted assimilation and maintained distinct political identities. Moreton-Robinson [@moreton-robinson2015] and Lynette Russell [@russell2020] suggest that Indigenous identity is more supple than settler-colonial constructions allow. It transcends notions of blood quanta and is shaped by connections to land, cultural practices, and concepts of kin and relatedness. Additionally, [@russell2020] highlights the more ambiguous currents of undecidability and uncertainty that also shape Indigenous identity.

Joronen and Griffiths [@joronengriffiths2022] remind us that settler-colonial projects always confront a fundamental condition of ungovernability: Indigenous life is never fully reducible to structures of domination. While settler states seek to govern through elimination, assimilation, and fragmentation, life persists in ways that exceed these logics, rendering colonial power structurally incomplete. Read alongside Wolfe’s (2006) “logic of elimination,” this perspective highlights settler-colonialism’s dual dynamic: elimination seeks to erase Indigenous presence, while ungovernability underscores its persistence. In Palestine, for example, the continued presence of Palestinians on the land despite displacement and dispossession exemplifies the limits of settler-colonial control.

However, it is important to recognise that claiming the land to be empty does not make the Indigenous populations disappear, even if settlers perceive it as such. As Wolfe suggests, while the elimination of Indigenous people can involve violent means, it can also generate a form of life by assimilating Indigenous peoples, their cultures, and their lands into the settler’s nation. This process of assimilation, as noted by Katherine Ellinghaus [@ellinghaus2009], limits the ability of Indigenous peoples to challenge the settlers’ claims to the land, hindering their ability to assert their rights and sovereignty.

This dynamic is acutely illustrated in the case of Palestine, where the settler-colonial logic of elimination took both violent and assimilative forms. In 1948, a mass displacement occurred in Palestine, now known as the Nakba, where around 770,000 Palestinians of the population, were forcibly expelled (this event will be discussed further down this chapter) from their homes and the territory that Zionist settler-colonials envisioned for their new state [@masalha1992; @morris2004; @sitta2001]. Edward Said [@said1979] also explores the history and ideology of Zionism in his book The Question of Palestine, which drew criticism for linking European colonialism with Zionism. In his work, he identifies three main interdependent ideas found in Zionist thought: the denial of the existence of Arab inhabitants in Palestine, the belief that the territory was empty, and the restorative Zionist project of building Jewish state using modern elements such as separate colonies and a specialised agency for land acquisition [@said1979, 68]. These ideas include the perception that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine are non-existent, the belief in an empty land, and the goal of rebuilding a Jewish state using modern methods [@said1979, 68]. Said draws parallels between the Zionist narrative of empty land and the perspective of Puritans, who viewed North America in a similar way, although nineteenth-century European colonial powers typically acknowledged the presence of native populations [@said1979]. Furthermore, Said highlights similarities between the experiences of Arab Palestinians under Zionism and those subjected to nineteenth-century imperialists’ dehumanising treatment [@said1979, 68-69].

Current research on the Palestinian issue often focuses on Palestine as an exceptional case of occupation, but there is a growing recognition of the framework of settler-colonialism [@salamanca2012]. Israel’s self-styled exceptionalism lies in the way it positions itself “above and outside domestic and international law regarding Palestinian citizens, as well as occupied, besieged and refugee subjects.” [@lentin2020]. Framing Israel as a settler-colonial state offers conceptual and political resources to challenge Israel’s exceptionalism and facilitates valid comparisons with other settler-colonial cases like South Africa, Rhodesia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia [@lentin2020].

Omar Salamanca et al. [@salamanca2012] highlight the perceived threat that Indigenous Palestinians pose to the Zionist project, as well as the challenge they continue to pose after the Nakba. Despite the efforts to forcefully remove Palestinians in the past, a significant number remained: after the Nakba, about 160,000 Palestinians became Israeli citizens and faced new challenges to their status [@salamanca2012]. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank after the 1967 conquest aimed to reproduce and make permanent the occupation, facilitating settler-colonialism [@veracini2013]. Unlike the period surrounding the Nakba, where violent expulsions occurred, many Palestinians did not leave in 1967 [@veracini2013]. As [@veracini2017, 5] highlights, the continuing presence of Palestinians in the territory challenges the notion of a triumphantly violent settler-colonialism that transforms Indigenous people’s place into space and then back into place again.

According to [@salamanca2012, 1], the Zionist project subjects Palestine and Palestinians to structural and violent forms of dispossession, land appropriation, and erasure in the pursuit of a new Jewish state and society. Veracini emphasises that settler-colonialism is not only a thing of the past but also a present reality [@veracini2011].

The following sections will provide an overview of key events from the rise of the Zionist project to the current situation, shedding light on the dominant powers affecting Palestinians.
