  abstract = {n 2018, Palestinians mark the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, when over 750,000 people were uprooted and forced to flee their homes in the early days of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even today, the bitterness and trauma of the Nakba remains raw, and it has become the pivotal event both in the shaping of Palestinian identity and in galvanising the resistance to occupation. Unearthing an unparalleled body of rich oral testimony, An Oral History of the Palestinian Nakba tells the story of this epochal event through the voices of the Palestinians who lived it, uncovering remarkable new insights both into Palestinian experiences of the Nakba and into the wider dynamics of the ongoing conflict. Drawing together Palestinian accounts from 1948 with those of the present day, the book confronts the idea of the Nakba as an event consigned to the past, instead revealing it to be an ongoing process aimed at the erasure of Palestinian memory and history. In the process, each unique and wide-ranging contribution leads the way for new directions in Palestinian scholarship.},

  abstract = {This paper questions the applicability of Giorgio Agamben's understanding and articulation of the `State of Exception' concept in the Occupied Palestinian territories. Through a detailed analysis of the Palestinian spatial conditions, it presents the different hierarchies, forms and experiences of exception Palestinians confront in their daily lives. It classifies four States of Exception: the State of Exile and Refuge; the State of Paradox; the State of Occupation and Siege: and the State of Urbicide. A detailed analysis of the States of Occupation, Siege and of Urbicide to demonstrate the several levels and experiences of exception is also presented. These experiences can be noted in phenomena from the legal and juridical framework of the Israeli occupation to the spatial surveillance, to the socio-cultural and economic dimensions of daily life, to the perceptual impacts of Urbicide on people's understanding of self, other and place. An analysis of the Palestinian modus of resilience and resistance is then explored. The paper's main arguments and analyses demonstrate that there are different forms of exception that are not limited to the juridical and legal aspects of Agamben's explanations of the State of Exception. These analyses also reveal how the Palestinians, through their resistance, constitute a real agency in shaping the geometry of the conflict. Agamben presents the State of Exception as the normal state of affairs versus the State of Exception, inside/outside sovereign/homo sacer, normal/abnormal, private/public and so on. The State of Exception for him is where an absolute use of power is performed by the sovereign against the victim who has no agency of resistance or rights as all laws are suspended and all notions are confused. It is argued that although these conditions are present in the Palestinian States of Occupation, Siege and Urbicide, using the previous juridical argument of Agamben alone might prove a barrier as it will hinder the understanding of the other hidden tensions and actions that take place within that State of Urbicide. However, it can be stated that there is a Palestinian State of Exception, but the Exception takes different forms and operates with different dynamics. The Palestinian States of Exception entail all aspects of life -- not only the juridical and legal -- creating multilevels of Exception that perpetually destroys and regenerates itself in an extreme form. Thus, this paper calls for a redefinition of the Palestinian States/Spaces of Exception that can explain this condition in its complicated, interconnected, and interactive layers, forms and dynamics.},

Ashjan Ajour examines how these prisoners use their bodies in anti-colonial resistance; what determines this mode of radical struggle; the meanings they ascribe to their actions; and how they constitute their subjectivity while undergoing extreme bodily pain and starvation. These hunger strikes, which embody decolonisation and liberation politics, frame the post-Oslo period in the wake of the decline of the national struggle against settler-colonialism and the fragmentation of the Palestinian movement. Providing narrative and analytical insights into embodied resistance and tracing the formation of revolutionary subjectivity, the book sheds light on the participants' views of the hunger strike, as they move beyond customary understandings of the political into the realm of the `spiritualisation' of struggle. Drawing on Foucault's conception of the technologies of the self, Fanon's writings on anti-colonial violence, and Badiou's militant philosophy, Ajour problematises these concepts from the vantage point of the Palestinian hunger strike.},

The theoretical material is presented in close conjunction with clinical data in the form of vignettes and case studies to illustrate the key points. Presentation of vignettes and case studies focuses on the multidimensional approach examining the contributions of psychoanalysis, emphasizing the act of dissociation (healthy and unhealthy). Specific attention is given to the internalization of the m/other/object as the ``listening other'', and the dissociated part/s that may result in an over idealized yet feared object. The final discussion focuses on how patients in therapy become able to transform fears into ``psychic space'' and breaking away from vulnerability, by developing a better ``sense of self'', as the result of having the therapists as the ``listening other''. The central theory of psychoanalysis as a form of treatment that enhances resilience in relation in working with patient experienced trauma considered, by the mean of assessing relationship change in transference as an objective method of determining patience psychical alteration.},

Ultimately, the article proposes four aspects for the adoption of friendship as a method in peace research by: 1) deconstructing the linearity in peace research methods; 2) multiplying data collection's methods; 3) including affects throughout the whole research process and 4) advocating for an insurgent peace research that vindicates long-term `transversal politics' and translocal coalition-building.},

I thus criticize Bonnie Honig's interpretation of that move and argue, instead, that Butler's ethical supplement to politics is her way of addressing the speechlessness that prima facie disavows the Palestinian claim to equality by coding their mourning as an act of vengeance against the colonial order. Having questioned Honig's oversight of the difference in the subject positionality of Butler's move, I then show that Butler's ethical-political frame of grievability functions as a theoretical performance of the kind of sororal conspiracy that Honig in fact offers as a more suitable model of democratic action.},

  abstract = {Turkey's democratic regime and its vicissitudes are dependent on a necropolitical undercurrent. This book presents a bold collection of essays that evaluate Turkey's recent history from the perspective of the necropolitical underpinnings of its precarious democracy. Combining cutting edge research and a diverse range of approaches from multiple disciplines, including political theory, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, history, international relations, and gender and sexuality studies, the book examines the multiple ways in which lives are brought into the fold of power and analyses how they are subjected to mechanisms of death and destruction, as well as modalities of infrastructural violence, strategic neglect and exposure. Focusing on themes such as martyrdom, counterinsurgency warfare, enforced disappearances and conscientious objection; sites such as emergency zones, cemeteries, monuments and borderlands; and institutions such as prisons, courts and the army, the collection offers a sobering and original analysis of contemporary Turkey and, thus indirectly, of the changing political dynamics of the Middle East. It points to the emergence of new forms of impoverishment, inequality and disposability. It provides a new and rich lexicon that makes a sophisticated contribution to the growing research program on violence in the critical humanities.},

None promote justice, none have brought resolution; none bode well for any of the parties involved. Here, an alternative Palestinian view of liberation and decolonization is provided by engaged Palestinian leaders and intellectuals, those who been actively involved in generating an ongoing Palestinian discourse on liberation, taking into account the parameters of their struggle as it now stands. Drawing on their own remarkable personal experiences and successes -- as archaeologists, artists, authors, community leaders, educators, filmmakers, historians, human rights activists, journalists, lawyers, spiritual leaders, political prisoners, and the like -- they address what now, what next, is to be done, in a manner that reflects not only Palestinian aspirations, but their view of what is possible. 'Liberation' is a term that was dropped from the official Palestinian lexicon simply because it was incompatible with the US-championed political discourse, but it has resurfaced here because without its justice dimensions, there can be no peace. Now that the international community is able to see that Oslo, along with the 'two-state solution' model, has irreversibly failed, the paradigmatic void has opened space for the articulation of new possibilities. Our Vision for Liberation embraces this opportunity to introduce a new Palestinian discourse, one that is able to address current challenges and obstacles to Palestinian rights and freedom, and provide diverse paths, all leading forward},

  abstract = {Background. Although much research has focused on mechanisms of traumatization and factors related to post-trauma psychological functioning in survivors of trauma, there have been few studies of survivors of torture despite the widespread practice of torture in the world. The aim of this study was to examine the role of `psychological preparedness' for trauma in post-traumatic stress responses in survivors of torture. Method. Thirty-four torture survivors who had no history of political activity, commitment to a political cause or group, or expectations of arrest and torture were compared with 55 tortured political activists, using structured interviews and measures of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Results. Compared with tortured political activists, tortured non-activists were subject to relatively less severe torture but showed higher levels of psychopathology. Less psychological preparedness related to greater perceived distress during torture and more severe psychological problems, explaining 4\% of the variance in general psychopathology and 9\% of the variance in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Conclusions. The study findings lend support to the role of prior immunization to traumatic stress and to unpredictability and uncontrollability of stressors in the effects of traumatization. Further research aimed at identifying the behavioural and cognitive components of psychological preparedness that play a role in traumatization may provide useful insights into effective treatment strategies for survivors of torture.},

This ``sex sells'' approach is increasingly employed to promote ethical causes, most prominently by the animal-rights organization PETA. Yet sexualized images can dehumanize women, leaving an unresolved paradox -- is it effective to advertise an ethical cause using unethical means? In Study 1, a sample of Australian male undergraduates (N = 82) viewed PETA advertisements containing either sexualized or non-sexualized images of women. Intentions to support the ethical organization were reduced for those exposed to the sexualized advertising, and this was explained by their dehumanization of the sexualized women, and not by increased arousal. Study 2 used a mixed-gender community sample from the United States (N = 280), replicating this finding and extending it by showing that behaviors helpful to the ethical cause diminished after viewing the sexualized advertisements, which was again mediated by the dehumanization of the women depicted. Alternative explanations relating to the reduced credibility of the sexualized women and their objectification were not supported. When promoting ethical causes, organizations may benefit from using advertising strategies that do not dehumanize women.},

Butler's new interpretation does nothing less than reconceptualize the incest taboo in relation to kinship---and open up the concept of kinship to cultural change. Antigone, the renowned insurgent from Sophocles's Oedipus, has long been a feminist icon of defiance. But what has remained unclear is whether she escapes from the forms of power that she opposes. Antigone proves to be a more ambivalent figure for feminism than has been acknowledged, since the form of defiance she exemplifies also leads to her death. Butler argues that Antigone represents a form of feminist and sexual agency that is fraught with risk. Moreover, Antigone shows how the constraints of normative kinship unfairly decide what will and will not be a livable life. Butler explores the meaning of Antigone, wondering what forms of kinship might have allowed her to live. Along the way, she considers the works of such philosophers as Hegel, Lacan, and Irigaray. How, she asks, would psychoanalysis have been different if it had taken Antigone---the "postoedipal" subject---rather than Oedipus as its point of departure? If the incest taboo is reconceived so that it does not mandate heterosexuality as its solution, what forms of sexual alliance and new kinship might be acknowledged as a result? The book relates the courageous deeds of Antigone to the claims made by those whose relations are still not honored as those of proper kinship, showing how a culture of normative heterosexuality obstructs our capacity to see what sexual freedom and political agency could be.},

Drawing on a growing body of literature and recent initiatives to codify ethics in forced migration studies, it highlights the transformational potential of a radical feminist care approach to the ``ethical turn'' in the field. I suggest that radical care ethics re-centers reciprocal human relationships in forced migration research to address specific ethical challenges posed by the criminalization of migration, extreme power asymmetries, precarities in migration status and politicization of migration policies. It is incumbent on all forced migration researchers to think proactively and carefully about ethics beyond procedures prescribed by institutional processes. I conclude with ways in which we can build on examples of radical care ethics in forced migration studies to imagine an ``otherwise'' (Povinelli 2012b) in our field.},

One canister landed only a few feet from 13-year-old Sliman Salah, enveloping him in a cloud of gas described by witnesses as an unfamiliar, yellow colour. Within a minute he was unconscious.},

  abstract = {This paper argues the built structure of Israeli military occupation in the West Bank is only part of the mechanism that serves to define territorial boundaries and restrict Palestinian movement. A more pervasive and debilitating process of boundary formation occurs through affect-laden performances that typically take place in border areas or sites of surveillance, where state actors and technologies police Palestinians. These performances serve to produce fear and shame: two affects that circulate and act as structuring agents preventing Palestinian movement and resistance. Thus, Israel extends its borders through socio-spatial-technical practices, deep into Palestinian spaces. The underlying evidence for this study originated out of critical performance ethnography and a drama workshop conducted with Palestinians, theorised in part through Sara Ahmed's notion of an `affective economy' of emotions. Overall, this study re-orients the predominant view of occupied space in the West Bank as an oppressive architectural blockade, to that of an affective regime constituted by a set of relations that require repeatable performances to produce the effect of territory. This re-framing opens possibilities for re-thinking resistance to the occupation by suggesting Palestinians may disrupt or alter the circulation of affect in order to reclaim their space and curtail Israeli extraterritorial ambitions.},

During the last Palestinian `al-Quds [Jerusalem] uprising' in October 2015, Israel again began withholding killed Palestinians' bodies, this time storing them in refrigerators. Tens of families experienced the detention and release of the frozen dead body of their relative. Drawing on 19 semi-structured interviews with families from al-Khalil (Hebron), this article traces Israel's political use of Palestinian bodies to dismantle Palestinian collectivity, and the Palestinians' use of the same bodies to rebuild their national collectivism. This article also describes Israel's use of its necropolitical and biopolitical powers to manage the Palestinian death, and the resistance strategies used by Palestinian families to oppose these powers. This study argues that necropolitics includes the coloniser's management of the colonised grief and bereavement, and the decisions about how, when, where and with whom the colonised should die. That is, it is the power to manage the structure and process of `letting die' and being dead.},

Drawing on the four major fields of anthropology, De Le{\dbend}n uses an innovative combination of ethnography, archaeology, linguistics, and forensic science to produce a scathing critique of "Prevention through Deterrence," the federal border enforcement policy that encourages migrants to cross in areas characterized by extreme environmental conditions and high risk of death. For two decades, systematic violence has failed to deter border crossers while successfully turning the rugged terrain of southern Arizona into a killing field. Featuring stark photography by Michael Wells, this book examines the weaponization of natural terrain as a border wall: first-person stories from survivors underscore this fundamental threat to human rights, and the very lives, of non-citizens as they are subjected to the most insidious and intangible form of American policing as institutional violence. In harrowing detail, De Le{\dbend}n chronicles the journeys of people who have made dozens of attempts to cross the border and uncovers the stories of the objects and bodies left behind in the desert.  \emph{The Land of Open Graves}  will spark debate and controversy.},

In addition to experiencing the same forms of repression as men, be it arrest, indefinite detention, or incarceration, Palestinian women have also been subjected to sexual violence and other gendered forms of coercion at the hands of the Israeli occupation regime. Drawing on testimonies from former and current female prisoners, this paper details Israel's incarceration policies and examines their consequences for Palestinian women and their families. It argues that Israel uses the incarceration of women as a weapon to undermine Palestinian resistance and to fracture traditionally cohesive social relations; and more specifically, that the prison authorities subject female prisoners to sexual and gender-based violence as a psychological weapon to break them and, by extension, their children.},

This article addresses this question by looking at the practice of sperm smuggling in Palestine as a life-affirming practice. The practice of sperm smuggling emerges in a context where reproductive injustices against Palestinians are daily occurrences of life under Israeli settler colonialism. The legal, social, and militarized targeting of Palestinian mothers and children, the mass incarceration of Palestinian men, and the attack on infrastructures of livability are Israeli biopolitical and necropolitical strategies of incapacitating the conditions necessary for the sustenance and reproduction of life in Palestine. Against this backdrop, the author argues that the practice of sperm smuggling circumvents settler-colonial efforts to curtail the reproduction of life and inaugurates a practice of life-making and a conception of life beyond its adjudication in the language of ``rights.'' Critically engaging with the work of Judith Butler and Rosi Braidotti, the author argues that sperm smuggling enacts an ``affirmation of life'' that refuses submission to the totalizing hold of physical, social, and political death.},

Symbolic violence built into a culture does not kill or maim like direct violence or the violence built into the structure. However, it is used to legitimize either or both, as for instance in the theory of a Herrenvolk, or a superior race. The relations between direct, structural and cultural violence are explored, using a violence triangle and a violence strata image, with various types of casual flows. Examples of cultural violence are indicated, using a division of culture into religion and ideology, art and language, and empirical and formal science. The theory of cultural violence is then related to two basic points in Gandhism, the doctrines of unity of life and of unity of means and ends. Finally, the inclusion of culture as a major focus of peace research is seen not only as deepening the quest for peace, but also as a possible contribution to the as yet non-existent general discipline of `culturology'.},

This residue was mainly illiterate villagers who were left without national and intellectual leadership. After a few years of frightened silence, a new intellectual stratum of young poets from this group began to publish reflections on their national situation. Intentionally simple, direct, and mainly easily memorized, their poetry became the ultimate cultural channel to create and disseminate a Palestinian version of the 1948 war, its subsequent state, and the vision of a desired future. These young poets gradually became the leading producers of Palestinian culture in Israel and abroad. Their poetry became the ultimate reference point for Palestine's national ethos and myths. Palestinians abroad named them the ``poets of resistance'' and their poems were composed into inflaming national songs. But while this new intellectual strata became active cultural producers, intervening in ``the nation building process,'' their social role remained ambivalent and problematic. Despite their national enthusiasm and appeal for social change, they were unable to transgress the patriarchic rule that was hegemonic in Palestinian society. This hegemonic narrative was interwoven in three themes: (1) using the lexicon of natural disaster to conceptualize the 1948 events, presenting them as an irresistible natural disaster (even by God who appeared during the events as pathetic and useless); (2) representing the Palestinian defeat in 1948 through patriarchal language of ``collective shame,'' ``land rape,'' and ``honor lost;'' and (3) articulating the national liberation project as masculine, promising to liberate the ``captured land-woman'' and to recover the collective honor of the nation.},

Both the record approach (Widom) studying later outcomes among abused children and the retrospective approach (Lewis) studying violent childhood experiences among offenders provide support for the violence breeds violence hypothesis. It appears clear that punishment in child-rearing increases the risk for maladaptive developmental outcomes but that the mechanism explaining the link between negative parenting and later maladjustment is still an unresolved issue. The review argues that a trauma model is the most interesting theoretical approach in explaining the mechanism.},

This book endeavors to show how normal people placed in extraordinarily difficult conditions created protections for their assets and buffered against outsider predation through property rights. The research project focuses on Palestinians living in seven refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. Using interviews with 200 Palestinian refugees, legal title documents, memoirs, and United Nations Relief Works Agency archives the author traces the evolution of property rights from informal understandings of ownership to formal legal claims of assets and resources to shed light on how communities thrive in challenging political economic spaces. Initially, Palestinians deployed bits and pieces of their pre-refugee life to craft property rights that met the challenges of living in refugee camps. Later, as the camps increased in complexity with expanding markets and new outsiders entering the political fray, then Palestinians strategically melded their informal institutional practices with the formal rules of political outsiders. Palestinian refugees, to varying degrees of success, managed to protect their assets and community from predation and state incorporation},

Manifestations and theories of dehumanization are reviewed, and a new model is developed. Two forms of dehumanization are proposed, involving the denial to others of 2 distinct senses of humanness: characteristics that are uniquely human and those that constitute human nature. Denying uniquely human attributes to others represents them as animal-like, and denying human nature to others represents them as objects or automata. Cognitive underpinnings of the ``animalistic'' and ``mechanistic'' forms of dehumanization are proposed. An expanded sense of dehumanization emerges, in which the phenomenon is not unitary, is not restricted to the intergroup context, and does not occur only under conditions of conflict or extreme negative evaluation. Instead, dehumanization becomes an everyday social phenomenon, rooted in ordinary social-cognitive processes.},

To lose bodily control over bodily fluids seems to put the individual's identity and human dignity at risk. The disturbing presence of odors, sights, and textures seems to have a disruptive effect on close relationships. The article further discusses how bodily dimensions of care add new burdens to modern family life in different social contexts and contribute to expand the gender gap in different cultures of care. This seems to be related to how ideas of individualism structure and are structured by economic and social conditions in which people live their everyday lives.},

  abstract = {"Everyday resistance is about the many ways people undermine power and domination through their routine and everyday actions. Unlike open rebellions or demonstrations, it is typically hidden, not politically articulated, and often ingenious. But because of its disguised nature, it is often poorly understood as a form of politics and its potential underestimated. Conceptualizing Everyday Resistance presents an analytical framework and theoretical tools to understand the entanglements of everyday power and resistance. These are applied to diverse empirical cases including queer relationships in the context of heteronormativity, Palestinian daily life under military occupation, workplace behaviors under office surveillance, and the tactics of fat acceptance bloggers facing the War against obesity. Johansson and Vinthagen argue that everyday resistance is best understood by accounting for different repertoires of tactics, relations between actors, and struggles around constructions of time and space. Through a critical dialogue with the work of James C. Scott, Michel de Certeau, and Asef Bayat, they aim to reconstruct the field of resistance studies, expanding what counts as resistance and building systematic analysis. Conceptualizing Everyday Resistance offers researchers and students from different theoretical and empirical backgrounds, an essential overview of the field and a creative framework that illuminates the potential of all people to transform society"--},

Forms of physical and psychological pain and suffering share some common neurobiological pathways and regulatory systems that are influenced by social and cultural factors. All forms of torture follow an affective logic rooted both in human biology and in local social and cultural meanings of experience. Understanding the impact of specific forms of torture on individuals requires knowledge of their learning histories, and of the personal and cultural meanings of specific kinds of violence. Exploring cultural meanings requires attention to over-arching discourse, embodied practices, and everyday engagements with an ecosocial environment. Restitution, treatment and recovery can then be guided by knowledge of cultural meanings, dynamics, and strategies for coping with catastrophic threats, injury, humiliation, helplessness and loss.},

  abstract = {t is impossible to understand Palestine today without a careful reading of its distant and recent past. But until now there has been no single volume in English that tells the history of the events--from the Ottoman Empire to the mid-twentieth century--that shaped modern Palestine. The first book of its kind,A History of Palestineoffers a richly detailed interpretation of this critical region's evolution. Starting with the prebiblical and biblical roots of Palestine, noted historian Gudrun Kramer examines the meanings ascribed to the land in the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions. Paying special attention to social and economic factors, she examines the gradual transformation of Palestine, following the history of the region through the Egyptian occupation of the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman reform era, and the British Mandate up to the founding of Israel in 1948. Focusing on the interactions of Arabs and Jews,A History of Palestinetells how these connections affected the cultural and political evolution of each community and Palestine as a whole.},

The paper critiques the focus on ethnicity as an analytical frame by Israeli scholars and posits race as a key concept in analising Zionist settler-colonialism. It proposes that rather than being a solution to European antisemitism, Zionism adopted discourses of race approximating those expressed by antisemitic regimes. As the Black Lives Matter movement proliferates, the article concludes by proposing that Palestine and the question of Palestine are becoming a truly global issue.},

One has focused on the denial of human attributes to groups (attribute-based dehumanization) and the other on the likening of group members to nonhumans (metaphor-based dehumanization). The relationship between these two approaches has yet to be examined. The current studies seek to clarify this relationship by integrating the two approaches. Using Haslam and colleagues' (Haslam, 2006; Haslam, Loughnan, Kashima \& Bain, 2008) model of dehumanization, we examined whether attribute-based dehumanization leads to metaphor-based dehumanization, and vice versa. In Study 1 participants read about a novel group that was described either as lacking one type of humanness or as being like a nonhuman. In Study 2 a concrete learning task taught participants that a novel group lacked a specific type of humanness. In both studies, participants explicitly learned to dehumanize the group and inferred the corresponding type of attribute- or metaphor-based perception (e.g. perceived a group as animal-like after learning that it lacked uniquely human attributes, and vice versa). Implicitly, however, participants were able to directly learn but not robustly infer the corresponding type of dehumanization. We suggest that the relationship between the two types of dehumanization can be understood using cognitive models of metaphor-making.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic experiences. We propose a socio-interpersonal model of PTSD that complements existing models of post-traumatic memory processes or neurobiological changes. The model adds an interpersonal perspective to explain responses to traumatic stress. The framework draws from lifespan psychology, cultural psychology and research into close relationships and groups. Additionally, clinical knowledge about PTSD is incorporated. This involves knowledge about shame, guilt, estrangement feelings and protective factors, such as social support and forgiveness. Three levels are proposed at which relevant interpersonal processes can be situated and should be adequately researched. First, the individual level comprises social affective states, such as shame, guilt, anger and feelings of revenge. Second, at the close relationship level, social support, negative exchange (ostracism and blaming the victim), disclosure and empathy are proposed as dyadic processes relevant to PTSD research and treatment. Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and social acknowledgement are concepts that predict the response trajectories to traumatic stress. Research by the current authors and others is cited in an effort to promote future investigation based on the current model. Methodological implications, such as multi-level data analyses, and clinical implications, such as the need for couple, community or larger-level societal interventions, are both outlined.

  abstract = {This article investigates Palestinian-Zionist colonial relations from the perspective of the interrogation encounter between Palestinian munadilin (strugglers) in prison and their interrogators from the Israeli security agency during the past forty years of Zionist settler colonization in Palestine. The interrogation site constitutes a condensation point for reading the colonial relations. Each interrogation encounter reflects a singular relation and simultaneously encodes the collective history of past, present, and future colonial relations. The interrogation encounter is a revealing ethnographic site for analyzing the dialectic of the colonial relations and how Palestinians have simultaneously carved out a space for a form of subjectivity and politics that breaks with the predicament of the colonial dialectic through the cultivation of sumud, or ``steadfastness.'' In the context of colonized Palestine, sumud has come to embody a whole range of significations, sensibilities, affections, attachments, aspirations, and practices. It is a form of subjectivity and politics that embodies the possibility of escaping hegemonic configurations of colonial liberal politics. To practice sumud in the interrogation means to refuse to confess in order to protect one's comrades, political organization, and community, as well as the Palestinian revolution more broadly. However, sumud is not a definable practice. For there are as many ways to practice sumud as there are Palestinians-in-sumud; the significance of sumud lies in its nonconceptualized features. Sumud is a form of what Gilles Deleuze might term ``singular revolutionary becoming,'' a creative way of restructuring the self that assumes an absolute difference as immanent to the self, a ``difference-in-itself,'' and not merely in relation to an outside other, as presupposed by the Hegelian dialectic. The article explicates the complex web of relations that sumud incarnates. Through ethnographic cases, it discusses the form of nonrecognitive politics made possible through sumud.},

Meari reflects on the political and theoretical dimensions of hunger strikes by Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli colonial prisons and illuminates their relationship to the history of the Palestinian liberation struggle and its transformations from the 1960s into the post-Oslo present. The interview situates the hunger strike at the center of a Palestinian political culture of anticolonial protest and argues that this form of strike manifests Palestinian aspirations for freedom that have continued to permeate the prison while transforming it into a space of struggle and reproducing Palestine as resistance. Each singular/collective hunger strike interrupts the colonial order within and beyond the prison walls and asserts Palestinians' persistent struggle for a liberated future. The demise of the collective hunger strike and the rise of individual strikes, Meari argues, does not necessarily signal the collapse of collective struggles. Rather, individual hunger strikes are what at present maintain the memory of past collective struggles and anticipate while activating anticolonial collectivity-in-struggle to come.},

Sedentarization of the Israeli Bedouin, although exposing them to a modern health care system, has given only partial answers to the issues of availability and spatial, functional, and cultural accessibility and compatibility of health services. Misconception of the primary health care (PHC) concept by service providers has resulted in lack of culturally appropriate intermediate medical technology and administration, and deficient health and health-related educational efforts.

The economic value of their children has declined, generating a latent fertility surplus. The Bedouin have begun to adopt a fertility rationality which contains stronger secular-materialistic elements, and consequently an ideal of a smaller family size compared to the previous traditional large-family ideal. Lost control over children as producers of resources in terms of assistance in the provision of family needs as well as their becoming consumers of resources, together with a desire to maintain the achieved standard of living are responsible for these changes. Several indirect indications suggest that fertility behavior options commensurate with the emerging values are practiced, but these must still be substantiated by further research.

La disminuci{\'o}n del valor econ{\'o}mico de los hijos ha engendrado un latente exceso de fertilidad. Frente a {\'e}sa, los beduinos han empezado a adoptar una actitud que contiene elementos de materialismo y secularismo, y en consecuencia un ideal de familia m{\'a}s reducida en comparaci{\'o}n con el ideal tradicional de familia numerosa. Causas de tales cambios son la p{\'e}rdida del control sobre los hijos en su calidad de productores recursos para abastecer a los necesidades familiares, el hecho de que las propios hijos se hayan transformado en consumidores de tales recursos, y el deseo de mantener el nivel de vida alcanzado. Ciertas indicaciones indirectas sugieren que en la conducta de fertilidad se practican opciones que son compatibles con los nuevos valores, pero eso tiene que ser probado todav{\'i}a por ulteriores investigaciones.},

  abstract = {The non-European, non-Christian world was colonized under international law that is known today as the Doctrine of Discovery. This common-law international Doctrine was codified into European international law at the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and in the Berlin Act of 1885 specifically to partition and colonize Africa. Thirteen European countries and the United States attended the four month Conference and then thirteen countries signed the Berlin Act on February 26, 1885. Under the Discovery Doctrine and the Berlin Act, European countries claimed superior rights over African nations and Indigenous Peoples. When European explorers planted crosses, signed hundreds of treaties, and raised flags in many parts of Africa, they were making legal claims of ownership and domination over the native nations and peoples, and their lands and assets. These claims were justified in the fifteenth and in the nineteenth centuries by racial, ethnocentric, and religious ideas about the alleged superiority of European Christian nations. This Article examines the application of the Doctrine and the Berlin Act by England and Germany in East Africa, the area that now comprises Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. This comparative law analysis demonstrates convincingly that the Berlin Act and these colonizing countries applied what we define as the ten elements of the Doctrine of Discovery. These elements had been developed and refined by European legal and political systems since the mid-1400s. Over 400 years later, the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 expressly and implicitly adopted and codified all ten elements to control the European partition and colonization of Africa. Germany and England used this international law to colonize East Africa. Needless to say, European domination, exploitation, and colonization seriously injured the human, property, sovereign, and self-determination rights of Indigenous nations and peoples and still impacts them today. The comparative legal analysis set out in this Article will benefit readers to see more clearly how law affected and directed African colonization, and to develop a better understanding of the international law of colonialism, that historic process, the impacts of colonization, and why this knowledge is of crucial importance to us all.},

Our paper proposes a unique legal-geographical perspective to the analysis of this dynamic, while anchoring the critique of the HCJ's work within an understanding of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank as a settler colonial project. Empirically, we focus on the Court's evolving jurisprudence in relation to the inclusion of expansion plans for the Jewish settlements in the routing of the separation barrier. Through a close reading of the legal texts, we demonstrate how the Court strove to subject the settler colonial logic of permanent spatial transformation and settlement expansion into the IL's imperatives of temporality and conservation. Through this case-study we propose a nuanced empirical and methodological approach to the study of contemporary settler colonial legalities. This approach focuses on the intertwinement of everyday professional practices of space and law in order to unravel the weaving of settler colonial logics into contemporary imperatives.},

Focusing on the Australian Aboriginal context, Aileen Moreton-Robinson questions current race theory in the first world and its preoccupation with foregrounding slavery and migration. The nation, she argues, is socially and culturally constructed as a white possession. Moreton-Robinson reveals how the core values of Australian national identity continue to have their roots in Britishness and colonization, built on the disavowal of Indigenous sovereignty. Whiteness studies literature is central to Moreton-Robinson's reasoning, and she shows how blackness works as a white epistemological tool that bolsters the social production of whiteness--displacing Indigenous sovereignties and rendering them invisible in a civil rights discourse, thereby sidestepping thorny issues of settler colonialism.Throughout this critical examination Moreton-Robinson proposes a bold new agenda for critical Indigenous studies, one that involves deeper analysis of how the prerogatives of white possession function within the role of disciplines.

Rather than simply hitching children's resistance to standard theories of resistance, Heidi Morrison seeks to meet children on their own terms. Through the case study of Palestinian children, contributors theorize children's resistance as an embodied experience called lived resistance. A critical aspect of the study of lived resistance is not just documenting what children do but specifically how scholars approach the topic of children's resistance. With Lived Resistance against the War on Palestinian Children, the authors account for the vessel (i.e., the body in flesh and mind) through which such resistance generates and operates. The diverse group of chapter authors examine Palestinian children's art and media, imprisonment, parenting experiences, bereavement, neoliberalism, refugee camps, and protest movements as aspects of their collective and individual political power. Through these outlets, the book shows consistencies and contends that these children's relationship to political power operates from an inclusive model of citizenship and is social justice oriented, symbolically oriented, and contingently based"-- Provided by publisher},

This simple observation and others have led some to speculate about a relationship between dissociation and violence. However, no systematic review of the literature has so far been published. To address this gap, studies assessing the prevalence of dissociation among violent individuals, and violence among highly dissociative persons, are reviewed. Possible links between dissociation and violent behavior are explored. It is concluded that dissociation predicts violence in a wide range of populations and may be crucial to an understanding of violentbehavior. There is a clear need, however, for large scale, well-designed studies using reliable structured instruments in a number of areas reviewed. Recommendations for clinical applications include the routine screening of offenders for dissociative disorders and adequate consideration of dissociation and dissociative disorders in the development and implementation of violence treatment and prevention programs.},

  abstract = {In this paper we examine the application of informed consent to ethnographic research in health care settings. We do not quarrel with either the principle of informed consent or its translation into the requirement that research should only be carried out with consenting participants. However, we do challenge the identification of informed consent with the particular set of bureaucratic practices of ethical review which currently operate in Canada, the US and elsewhere. We argue that these anticipatory regulatory regimes threaten the significant contribution of ethnographic research to the creation of more efficient, more effective, more equitable and more humane health care systems. Informed consent in ethnographic research is neither achievable nor demonstrable in the terms set by anticipatory regulatory regimes that take clinical research or biomedical experimentation as their paradigm cases. This is because of differences in the practices of ethnographic and biomedical research which we discuss. These include the extended periods of time ethnographers spend in the research setting, the emergent nature of ethnographic research focus and design, the nature and positioning of risk in ethnographic research, the power relationships between researchers and participants, and the public and semi-public nature of the settings normally studied. Anticipatory regulatory regimes are inimical to ethnographic research and risk undermining the contribution of systematic inquiry to understanding whether institutions do what they claim to do, fairly and civilly and with an appropriate mobilisation of resources. We do not suggest that we should simply ignore ethics or leave matters to the individual consciences of researchers. Rather, we need to develop and strengthen professional models of regulation which emphasise education, training and mutual accountability. We conclude the paper with a number of suggestions about how such professional models might be implemented.},

  abstract = {Objective: It has commonly been found that abused children are at risk for later becoming abusive parents (Kaufman \& Zigler, 1987; Oliver, 1993) and observational learning has been discussed as a mechanism that perpetuates this intergenerational cycle of abuse. However, two thirds of abused children do not become abusive (Kaufman \& Zigler, 1987). Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine whether dissociation functions as an additional mechanism mediating the relation between a history of child abuse and abusiveness as an adult.Method: A cross-sectional design was used to examine physical abuse history, dissociation, and physical abuse potential in a sample of 190 college students. Questionnaires were utilized to assess the three constructs.Results: Findings indicated that the three constructs were intercorrelated. In particular, a newly established association was found between dissociation and physical abuse potential (r = .54, p {$<$} .0001). The primary finding was that the relation between physical abuse history and physical abuse potential was significantly mediated (z = 2.19, p {$<$} .05) by level of dissociation, with dissociation accounting for approximately half of the observed relation between history of abuse and abuse potential.Conclusion: Results suggested that dissociation may be one mechanism that helps to perpetuate the intergenerational cycle of abuse. Although dissociation promotes psychological survival during children's abuse experiences, it may result in the development of abusive tendencies in later life. Reducing parental dissociation may assist clinicians in preventing or terminating physical child abuse.},

Intersectional Decoloniality centres the stories of 33 Palestinian women in different socio-political and urban/village/refugee camp locations to make visible their decolonial action against Israeli settler colonialism and for Palestinian futurities. Decolonial Co-Resistance is a methodology of gathering, analyzing and mobilizing those stories, toward co-liberation, through co-resistance actions and narrating lifetimes of struggle. This research foregrounds decolonial love of Palestinian-ness, Palestinian community, ancestors and the land, as the foundation of women's decolonial action. Next, it details how the Palestinian women who participated in this study mobilize decolonial visions as the hope which sustains the struggle. Together, hope and love allow the co-creation of beloved community as a pathway to healing colonial fragmentation of Palestinians and فلسطين Palestine. Finally this research explores direct action for co-liberation, as women's organizing based on community priorities and protection of المسجد الأقصى al-Aqsa Mosque, and as a way to both prefigure and incrementally achieve the relations of freedom necessary to liberate and decolonize Palestine.},

Paying attention to the concrete corporeality of dehumanization as it is described in testimonial texts, the author suggests that to think of ``human dignity'' as an abstract and disembodied quality becomes problematic in its failure to recognize the embodied, lived experience of suffering human beings. By focusing on testimonial accounts of dehumanizing atrocity, this chapter points to the significance of our role as receivers of testimony, also potentially guilty of dehumanizing perception, and emphasizes the possibility within the testimonial encounter both to repeat and to resist the logic of dehumanization and the unmaking, self-destroying power of bodily pain.},

The study serves as a reference for policymakers, development practitioners, and private sector actors. It used a three-pronged approach to data collection, analysis, and synthesis. First, a literature review was conducted to identify results and outcomes of recently implemented lead firm - SME linkage programs. Second, the literature review helped identify examples of initiatives focused on linking lead firms and agro-processing SMEs in 56 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Data from 66 projects were examined in a meta-analysis to refine the findings from the literature review. Third, six linkage initiatives with a broad range of projects in numerous locations were selected for in-depth analysis and inclusion in the report as case studies. The guidance note for policy makers aims to provide guidance to policymakers hoping to promote the growth of agro-processing SMEs by positioning them as suppliers to larger firms. The six case studies are intended to provide development practitioners with further details and contextual insights, which they can consider when designing lead firm - SME linkage programs.},

Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called "ethnic cleansing".

  abstract = {Abstract The sociology of the Middle East has been an expanding field of inquiry since the aftermath of WWII when phenomena as diverse as urbanization, internal and international migration, and peasant societies attracted the attention of scholars working on the region. The Middle East became central in key sociological debates on modernization theory and the critical responses. The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of the Middle East connects this historical trajectory with the emergence of the sociology of Islam, inspired by Max Weber. It explores how within the global community, the Middle East has become a terrain of heightened concern within the post-Cold War context, where the promising rise of civic (and often religiously-inspired) sociopolitical movements in the 1980s and 1990s has been slowly overwhelmed by the affirmation of jihadist networks, authoritarian states, and complex supranational security apparatuses. This foundational volume starts by engaging in a critical examination of the field itself, starting with a historical sociology of the making of the idea itself of the Middle East and linking it with the legacy of colonialism and the evolving dynamics of global power. In repurposing the sociology of the Middle East within a growing interdisciplinary multifield, the Handbook develops the critical argument that the exploration of social dynamics in the Middle East cannot be disjoined from the analysis of culture and politics. By connecting the vexed state-society relations in the region with movements of transformation and the affirmation of rights and creativity in the public arenas, it provides a comprehensive perspective to investigate longstanding regional and new transregional and global dynamics and their impact on the life of people in the region.},

  abstract = {Education in Israel is often described as caught between two ends: state-formation and nation-building. In the last decade civic education in Israel has been undergoing some changes. The civic compulsory curriculum for state high schools was unified across all educational sectors in Israel with the aim of creating a more inclusive, universal civic curriculum that would be used as a platform for creating a common civic culture. The tension between state-formation and nation-building, between universalism and particularism, thus, has become even more prominent where civic education is concerned. To a significant extent, civic education in Israel is one place where contesting messages about the meaning of membership in the Israeli collective are negotiated and debated. This paper explores the tensions between inclusion and exclusion and between universalism and particularism as they emerge from the official civic education curriculum in Israel. It does so by examining the representations and positions of the Palestinian citizens in the official discourse of civic education. The analysis suggests that civic education in Israel at best represents an ambivalent stance that is caught in the tension between inclusion and exclusion. But more often than not, it still reproduces the marginal position of the Palestinian minority in Israeli society. In light of this, this paper concludes by discussing the possible implications these dual messages might have for Palestinian students.},

  abstract = {The use of vigorous shaking by Israeli security agents to interrogate prisoners has been severely criticised in separate reports by Amnesty International and Physicians for Human Rights. Shaking, which the reports warn is a form of torture with a potentially lethal outcome, is used mainly against suspected Islamic terrorists opposed to the Palestine Liberation Organisation's peace treaty with Israel. Physicians for Human Rights has released the necropsy report of Abd al-Samad Harizat, a Palestinian who died in custody after being severely shaken last April. According to Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of the organisation, which is based in Boston, this is the first documented case of a prisoner dying after this form of torture. The necropsy report said that Abd al-Samad Harizat had a parietal subdural haematoma and injuries to the upper chest that together suggested violent shaking. Furthermore, microscopic examination of the brain and eyes, conducted after the necropsy by Israeli pathologists, found diffuse brain and retinal injuries. The necropsy findings have been likened to those in the ``shaken baby syndrome'' by Dr Robert Kirschner, director of Physicians for Human Rights' international forensic programme. He wrote in a letter to the High Court of Justice in Jerusalem: ``In both infants and adults the shaking produces a differential motion between the skull and the brain such that the brain will continue in motion after the motion of the head has stopped, causing shearing of neuronal axons during deformation of the brain, and contusions of the surface of the brain{\dots}. Shaking poses a grave risk of severe and permanent cerebral injury.'' Despite the concerns of Israeli and international human rights organisations, in mid-October the Israeli government renewed the authority of the secret services to shake subjects during interrogation. The shaking of detainees has been documented since the 1980s but has been on the increase in recent years, according to Amnesty International's report. Former detainees report that before being shaken they are sat with their legs shackled below a low chair and are handcuffed behind and between the bars of the chair. This makes them less able to resist violent shaking. They have also told Amnesty that the shaking is usually continuous for several minutes and is then repeated at intervals. Amnesty reports that shaking is a form of torture rarely reported outside Israel and the Occupied Territories and believes that it is one of the permitted ``special measures'' included in secret guidelines approved by government officials},

Factor analysis of the associated emotions and memory characteristics suggested the existence of specific links between fear and reliving, and helplessness and out-of-body experiences.

In this reflection and response, I read this against the recent calls to reconsider the nebulous concept of `Australian values' as a defining principle of belonging in and to the nation-state. Echoing the 1950s `Australian way of life' discourse, these values are overwhelmingly white, European and middle class. The place of Indigenous people in this conversation is both unclear and unsettled. As a settler colony, Australia has struggled to accommodate, celebrate or reconcile the relationship between the nation's `First people'. Settler colonial theory, and what Patrick Wolfe called the `elimination of the native', can be a useful lens for considering these issues. However, it is also clear that settler colonial theory has not attracted Indigenous scholars as it might have been expected to do. I briefly consider the place and role of Indigenous people in these debates and the shifts that have taken place over the past few decades.},

Through the stories and ordeals of women in poli- tically conflicted areas and war zones, and by sharing voices of Palestinian women from the Occupied Territories, it is shown that claims based on `security reasoning', fear from `terrorism', nationalism, preservation of `cultural authenticity', and preservation of the land can turn women's bodies and lives into boundary markers and thus sites of violence, con- testation, and resistance.},

As a result of these studies, it has become clear that successive generations of Israeli citizens (and non-citizens) are exposed to a single historical and cultural narrative. Such a narrative is intentionally designed to strengthen the emergent ethno-national character of Israeli democracy. This study examines a selection of Jewish--Israeli teachers' reflections on teaching in Israeli high school history and civics classrooms, and the institutionalized racism that they encounter both within the textbooks and from their students. I will demonstrate that these reflections are examples of negotiating dilemmatic spaces, resulting from the unique `structural conditions and relations to everyday practices' that Israeli educators must face. Israeli teachers must mediate the curricular materials vis-{\`a}-vis the degrees of freedom they are provided to teach counter-historical narratives and their own emotional responses to both the content of the textbooks and their students' reactions to the dominant national narrative presented therein.},

I bring together stories from my experiences talking with survivors across many countries---including Palestine, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom. Through employing ethnographic and autoethnographic methods, I argue that resilience expectations may impose supernatural coping mechanisms on communities struggling with adversities, romanticize them as exemplary in enduring injustices, obscure their humanity, and normalize (structural) violence they continue to experience or reduce its severity. I question who benefits from an overemphasis on and financing of resilience, especially within (international) development organizations. The communities I spoke with all contend that resilience is not just a useless word but also a discourse, a way of thinking, and a policy implemented during difficulties. They emphasize that the cheap (re)production of them as extraordinary people, who are expected to endure suffering, is violent because it places the onus on them to be resilient on issues beyond their control while, often, ignoring layers of (structural) violence and subsequent traumas they face. As an alternative discourse to resilience, I propose a collective and caring approach that deals with root causes of violence instead of ignoring them.},

  abstract = {The final decades of the twentieth century were accompanied by an upsurge in the number of persons fleeing persecution and regional wars. To stem the flow of asylum seekers, several countries in the west introduced policies of deterrence, including detention. Although many countries detain asylum seekers, Australia has been unique in establishing a policy of mandatory, indefinite detention. The impact of prolonged detention on the mental health of asylum seekers drew commentary from mental health professionals soon after the policy was introduced, but administrators and politicians disputed the assertion that detention was a factor in causing or exacerbating mental disorder. This overview examines the impact of mandatory, indefinite detention on the mental health of asylum seekers by drawing on evidence gathered during Commissions of Inquiry, from observations of health and mental health professionals who have worked in detention centres, and from the small body of systematic research undertaken among immigration detainees. The data from all sources converge in demonstrating that prolonged detention has adverse mental health and psychosocial impacts on adults, families and children. Recent studies suggest that the mental health effects may be prolonged, extending well beyond the point of release into the community. The Australian experience offers general lessons to health professionals worldwide about the importance of remaining vigilant in protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, and more specifically, to ensure that the traumas that cause mental suffering in refugees are not compounded as a consequence of immigration policy decisions in recipient countries. Documentation and research can be vital in achieving policy change in these settings.},

Research has also documented the protective influence of individuals' connection to community and their involvement in work, school or political action. Additionally, research on political violence and resilience has increasingly focused on communities themselves as a unit of analysis. Community resilience, like individual resilience, is a process supported by various traits, capacities, and emotional orientations towards hardship.

Fieldwork and its textual products represent an intervention into a system of relationships that the researcher is far freer than the researched to leave.

  abstract = {"What would you do if you grew up repeatedly seeing your home raided? Your parents arrested? Your mother shot? Your uncle killed? Try, if just for a moment, to imagine this was your life. How would you want the world to react?" Ahed Tamimi's father was born in 1967, the year that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank began, and every aspect of their family's life has been touched by it. One of Ahed's earliest memories is visiting her father in prison, poking her three-year-old fingers through the fence to touch his hand. The ubiquitous security checkpoints and armed guards even found their way into her childhood fairytales and playdates. Her grandmother regaled her not with nursery rhymes, but with the sage of her family and its tragedies. Instead of cops and robbers, there was Jaysh o 'Arab, or "Army and Arabs," where children roleplayed as Israeli soldiers opposing a community of Palestinians. She recounts all of this and more in her vivid and riveting memoir, one of the first to deal directly with what life in occupation actually means for the people in it, beyond geography or policy. It brings readers into the daily life of the young woman seen as a freedom-fighting hero by some and a na{\"i}ve agitator by others. Beyond recounting her well-publicized interactions with Israeli soldiers, there is her unwavering commitment to family and her fearless command of her own voice, despite threats, intimidation, and even incarceration"--},

While various interventions have tried to dislodge the aims of replacement, the settler colonial curricular project of replacement is relentless in its recuperation and absorption of those critiques, effectively replacing those who offered the critiques with (now) more informed white bodies.},

Even in feminist care theory, however, the neediness of the body is barely recognized as political. This is somewhat paradoxical, given that the vulnerable body is discursively deeply feminized. Thus, through a deconstructive reading of feminist care theory and Joan Tronto's (199339. Tronto, J. 1993. Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic of Care. New York and London: Routledge.View all references) ethics of care in particular, I argue for a new political understanding of care, defined as a corporeal relation. In this conception, the political dimensions of care are no longer understood in terms of work or the moral dispositions enabled by caring, as the existing literature largely suggests. Rather, the political relevance of care is seen as departing from that which makes the work of care an absolute necessity: namely, the needy body that belongs to each and every one of us. Through its neediness, the vulnerable body exposes itself as a constant opening of the political, the recognition of which also leads to an alternative type of ethics.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, scholarship has sought to redress genocide studies' lack of attention to assaults against Indigenous group life in settler colonial contexts. While this scholarship has made important interventions into a field dominated by the Holocaust prototype, work on genocides targeting Indigenous peoples has still laboured under the shadow of this paradigm's norms, including the prioritization of time-intense direct violence enacted with explicit intent. Studies of settler colonial genocide have consequently tended to focus upon specific, temporallybound historical policies and events despite the fact that such assaults are part of settler colonialism's persistent structure of invasion. In 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada challenged this casespecific approach, arguing that violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people is part of a protracted, ongoing genocide against Indigenous nations. In this article, I expand upon the Inquiry's consideration of slower, less direct modes of group destruction. To do so, I draw upon scholarship on genocide by attrition---a concept not mentioned in the Inquiry's report. Despite their shared concerns, studies of genocide by attrition and settler colonial genocide have yet to engage each other substantially. I consider how cross-pollination between these fields helps to challenge restrictive equations of genocide with time-intensive direct violence. Additionally, I develop a framework for addressing the cumulative harms that accrue when multiple genocidal processes are waged upon Indigenous nations as part of settler colonialism's long emergency. Finally, I consider how settler colonial genocidal processes necessitate a more nuanced, knowledge-based interpretation of intent---an approach that illuminates how the consequences of protracted assaults become undeniable and, therefore, undeniably intended as they proceed in slow motion.},

Although it draws from disciplines such as peace and conflict research (in and outside of international relations [IR]) as well as feminist security studies, it also differs from them in terms of research scope and research design. Consequently, it not only provides insights on what can be termed ``spectacular'' instances of violence or peace but also sharpens our analysis of the everydayness of reconciliatory measures and the mundaneness of both violence and peace. As a feminist endeavor, feminist peace research necessarily asks questions about unequal gender relations and power structures within any given conflict environment. In this collective discussion piece, a diverse group of scholars, who formed part of the recently convened Feminist Peace Research Network, explores and further develops the parameters of this emergent field through a set of short conversation pieces.},
